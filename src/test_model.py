test_text = "Artificial intelligence, often abbreviated as AI, refers to the set of theories and techniques implemented to create machines capable of simulating human intelligence. Its development has accelerated over the last two decades, thanks in particular to the increasing power of processors and the massive availability of digital data. AI has numerous applications: image recognition, natural language processing, autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and even climate forecasting. However, this technological revolution also raises major challenges. On the one hand, the energy costs associated with training and running large computing models are skyrocketing, contributing to the global carbon footprint of digital technology. On the other hand, the massive use of data raises ethical questions about privacy, transparency, and algorithmic bias. Faced with these challenges, new approaches are seeking to make AI more sustainable, more responsible, and more understandable. The “Design for Green” concept aims precisely to design resource-efficient artificial intelligence systems while maintaining acceptable performance. This approach encourages researchers and engineers to rethink their practices, systematically measure energy consumption, and prioritize simplicity over excessive power."
